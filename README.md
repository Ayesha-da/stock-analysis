# Stock Analysis using VBA

## Overview of Project
To perform data analysis on stock data to determine which stock is better for investment.

### Purpose
To analyze different stocks data throughout multiple years to see which stocks performed better.To achieve this purpose, yearly volume is calculated for each stock along with yearly return.The original code is then refactored to check efficiency.

## Results
### Refactored script
Refactoring is a coding process to make the code more efficientâ€”by taking fewer steps, using less memory, or improving the logic of the code to make it easier to read.
TickerIndex variable is created to access the correct index across four different arrays:ticker array, tickervolumes,tickerstartingprice and tickerendingprice, iterating over all the rows.

The refactored code execution time is less for year 2017 and 2018 than original code run time for 2017 and 2018.
